/* 
For smooth transition : 

code : 
<div className={`transition-transform ${open ? 'translate-y-0 duration-300' : 'translate-y-full'}`}>
  Content goes here
</div>

Code explanation : 

// <div> Element:
This is a standard HTML div element that serves as a container for the content.

// Template Literal:
The className attribute uses a template literal (backticks `) to dynamically set the CSS classes.
Template literals allow embedding expressions within a string using ${expression} syntax.

// transition-transform:
This is a utility class, typically from a CSS framework like Tailwind CSS, that enables smooth transitions for transform properties (e.g., translate, rotate, scale).

// Conditional Classes:
${open ? 'translate-y-0 duration-300' : 'translate-y-full'}:
This is a ternary operator that checks the value of the open state.
If open is true, the classes translate-y-0 and duration-300 are applied.
If open is false, the class translate-y-full is applied instead.

// CSS Classes:
translate-y-0: This class sets the vertical translation of the element to 0, meaning the element is in its original position.
duration-300: This class sets the duration of the transition to 300 milliseconds, creating a smooth effect.
translate-y-full: This class translates the element vertically by 100% of its height, effectively moving it out of view (usually downwards).
Behavior

// When open is true:
The classes translate-y-0 and duration-300 are applied.
This means the element is positioned normally (no vertical translation) and any transformation will take 300 milliseconds.
The element will smoothly transition to its normal position if it was previously translated.

// When open is false:
The class translate-y-full is applied.
This moves the element out of view by translating it downwards by 100% of its height.
Since no duration class is specified, the transition time might fall back to a default value or no transition effect will be applied (depending on your CSS setup).
